# Chinese-QASystem
Chinese question answering system based on BLSTM and CRF.
<br>
<br>

Requirement
-------
tensorflow 1.5<br>
numpy<br>
thulac<br>
scikit-learn<br>
matplotlib<br><br>

DataSet
-----
百度的中文问答数据集[WebQA](https://www.spaces.ac.cn/archives/4338/)，非常感谢该链接的作者对数据的整理。<br><br>

How to get start?
-----
    1.Download the raw data and extract it to the folder where the source code is located.
    2.python3 make_tfrecords.pyProcessing the raw data to generate the tfrecord files for training and validating.In this experiment,I       used 200,000 corpus to train and validate the accuracy of the model on 5000 corpus.All the training results as shown below.It is not     hard to find that the model eventually achieved an accuracy of 0.6050 on the validation set.
    3.python3 train.py.It will generate folder "logs"  to store log files,which tensorboard can be used to observe loss curve of training and the accuracy curve of the validation set.All models generated during training process are stored in the folder "model".<br>

Note
----
In the future, I will write a blog to introduce this work and you will learn how to use tensorflow's tf.while_loop interface to implement conditional random field training and Viterbi decoding.<br><br>
